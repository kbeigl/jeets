= Import JeeTS Repository in Eclipse

There are several ways to import the projects into Eclipse.

[[Building-CloningtheGitRepository]]
=== Cloning the Git Repository

Clone the Git repository with Eclipse by selecting 
*File -> Import -> Git / Projects from Git* and *Clone URI*.
Provide all repository details in the import wizard and clone the
repository into a directory outside of the Eclipse workspace. Once
cloning has completed, exit the import project wizard (i.e. simply
select cancel when asked to select "Wizard for project import").

NOTE: In a distributed development the IDE should not influence
the compiled output. Developers should not use Eclipse to clone the repo,
but rather follow the instruction for 'A normal build' described above.
The code can be developed, compiled, tested and installed from Eclipse,
but as a common practive Developers should _always_ run a 'mvn clean install'
from command line _before_ committing their work.

[[Building-m2e]]
== m2e

The complete JeeTS repository can be imported into Eclipse using m2e
Maven integration.

[[Building-ImportMavenProjects]]
=== Import Maven Projects

Import Camel projects as Maven projects using m2e by selecting *File ->
Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects*. Point the wizard to the
root directory of the cloned repository. Eclipse will analyze all Camel
projects and eventually present the following summary:

Simply confirm the import of all projects by clicking *Finish*. The
import process will create Eclipse projects and automatically set up
build paths using dependency details provided by the pom.xml files. Once
completed, all Camel projects will be available in your workspace
as you can see on the left side.
You can always point the import dialog to the JeeTS root directory
and then un/check the projects you want to work with.
Higher level projects will be composed with lower level projects
via local Maven Repository and _not_ via IDE workspace!


NOTE: As you can see the JeeTS repository is combined with multiple sub projects/modules 
      (e.g. components, archetypes, tooling etc.). Many sub projects/modules are again 
      categorized or packaged with another layer of sub modules and so on. 
      Developers can import project/module which is relevant to them and work on it 
      instead importing entire project which will consume memory and eventually slow down Eclipse. 
      This approach is not only easy to import and work in eclipse as well as easy to test.

[[Building-maven-eclipse-plugin]]
== maven-eclipse-plugin

Please check 
  link:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/[project home] 
to find:

NOTE: This plugin is retired. It is no longer maintained.

The Maven Eclipse Plugin is used to generate Eclipse IDE files 
(*.classpath, *.project, *.wtpmodules and the .settings folder) 
for use with a project.

WARNING: Disclaimer: Users are advised to use m2e, the Eclipse Maven Integration instead of this plugin, as it can more closely resemble the actual build and runtime classpaths as described in the project pom.xml - among other advantages. However, there are project setups and workflows that still work more efficiently with statically generated Eclipse metadata - for example when there is a large number of projects in a reactor. That's where the Maven Eclipse Plugin can still help you.


The maven-eclipse-plugin can be used to generate the
.classpath .project and .settings files that Eclipse needs. 
To do this, run:

[source,text]
----------------------------------------
mvn process-test-sources eclipse:eclipse
----------------------------------------

or

[source,text]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
mvn -Psetup.eclipse -Declipse.workspace.dir=/path/to/your/workspace
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The latter is recommended as it would completely setup the workspace for
you as well as provide options to wire in other projects also found in
your workspace.

After running the above command, from within Eclipse, do *File -> Import
-> Existing Projects into Workspace*, select the root camel checkout
location and Eclipse should find all the projects.
