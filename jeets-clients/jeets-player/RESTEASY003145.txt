
If you run into the error RESTEASY003145:

F:\virtex\repo.jeets\jeets-player>java -jar target\jeets-player-0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Problems determining version differences. 
RESTEASY003145: Unable to find a MessageBodyReader of content-type application/json 
                and type class de.hvv.response.InitResponse

you can currently fix this manually:

Just adding the line 
	org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.providers.jackson.ResteasyJacksonProvider 
into 
	META-INF/services/javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers file,
solves the problem.

This solution should be tested on a longer term 

The problem actually is that RestEasy is unable to find the Jackson provider. 
I had to manually register it by the following code:

   ResteasyProviderFactory instance=ResteasyProviderFactory.getInstance();
    RegisterBuiltin.register(instance);
    instance.registerProvider(ResteasyJacksonProvider.class);
    
Everything is working fine with this. 
But I am still unhappy with the solution as Resteasy is supposed 
to scan for the providers and register them automatically.

Solve this with version upgrades or Maven handling ?
