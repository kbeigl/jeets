   ===============
   
   my-jeets-client will become an (1) artifact 
   to create (2) jeets-client-gtfs and
   to create (3) jeets-client-rest (GeoFox)

   (1)
   will only provide simple database demo
   with traccar pu and recorded data !
   
   (2)
   can be created from artifact (1)
   > delete database
   > replace with (4) jeets-pu-gtfs !!

   instructions to download and load HVV data

   (3)
   can be created from artifact (1)
   > delete database
   > replace with (5) jeets-pu-geofox 
   > CONFIDENTIAL !! for my jeets server !!
   
   Currently all three are in one project
   And another GtfsFactoryWithViews, should be removed completly
   
   (2) and (3) should be streamlined and 
   *** both work with GTFS methods *** 
   as much as possible !!
   List<Position> createPositionTrip(GtfsFactory gtfs, GtfsTrip trip) 
   List<Builder>  composeCourseTrack(List<CourseElement> courseElements) 
   the latter can easily be modified to return List<Position> 
   as a good start.
   
   (4)
   create jeets-pu-gtfs project
   create gtfs entities with hibernate tools
   
   main question:
   add foreign key relations to database
   or only in Java Entities !? should work
   
   then move org.jeets.playback.gtfs to new project
   leave hand made pu org.jeets.model.gtfs behind
   and reengineer transit and gtfsFactory to new model
   should be a rewarding task :)
