   ===============
   
   my-jeets-client will become an (1) artifact 
   to create (2) jeets-client-gtfs and
   to create (3) jeets-client-rest (GeoFox)

   (1)
   will only provide simple database demo
   with traccar pu and recorded data !
   
   (2)
   can be created from artifact (1)
   > delete database
   > replace with (4) jeets-pu-gtfs !!

   instructions to download and load HVV data

   (3)
   can be created from artifact (1)
   > delete database
   > replace with (5) jeets-pu-geofox 
   > CONFIDENTIAL !! for my jeets server !!
   
   Currently all three are in one project
   And another GtfsFactoryWithViews, should be removed completly
   
   (2) and (3) 
   - both work and return a List<Position> with stops
   - but sometimes (defined by date and time) the lists defer from each other !?
   - and sometimes the GTFS stoptimes deviate by a few hours
   - GTFS queries need to be improved to handle hours > 23 (up to 29!)
   - both lists still have to enriched like in the deprecated GeoFox method ..
   - lists fix times are still adopted to play immediately instead of by live time stamp 
   - GeoFox ist deactivated in pom and java classes are .inactive
     since it causes logging conflict at database access

   (4)
   create jeets-pu-gtfs project
   create gtfs entities with hibernate tools
   main question:
   add foreign key relations to database
   or only in Java Entities !? should work, preferred
   
   then move org.jeets.playback.gtfs to new project
   leave hand made pu org.jeets.model.gtfs behind
   and reengineer transit and gtfsFactory to new model
   should be a rewarding task :)
