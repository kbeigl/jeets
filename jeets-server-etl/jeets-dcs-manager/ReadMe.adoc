= JeeTS-dcs-manager

The JeeTS DCS Manager combines JeeTS and Traccar Protocols 
to a single Spring Boot Application,
which can be launched from the command line of any (production) environment
or can be integrated to existing systems with Enterprise Integration Patterns.
Therefore the `jeets-dcs-manager` can also be referred to as ...

= *The Traccar DCS MicroService*

The JeeTS DCS Traccar is a stand alone `@SpringBootApplication` Microservice
to run any or all Device Communication Servers, i.e. Protocol Servers of the Traccar GTS.
And to develop additional or alternative protocols in the `jeets-protocols` project.
The main idea was to create a stand alone application to explicitly 
run the Traccar Device Communication Servers on different ports 
and to collect the Java System Entities at a single Consumer Endpoint 
for subsequent standardized processing in a Tracking System.


== The Spring Framework

link:https://spring.io/[The Spring Framework] 
can be considered as the _de facto_ successor of JEE:
[quote]
"Core support for dependency injection, transaction management, web
applications, data access, messaging, testing and more.
The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and
configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on
any kind of deployment platform. +
A key element of Spring is infrastructural
support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of
enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business
logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments. +
Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Springâ€™s focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has made it the world's most popular Java framework." 

// What more can we say? +
// Visit the Spring site and code anything you want.

The `jeets-dcs-manager` project is providing Traccar Protocols
for Spring technologies and you can simply use 
_the DCS Manager as a Component to hide the Camel and Netty details_ 
of the `jeets-protocols-traccar` _subproject_.
If you know Spring, little about Camel and even less about Netty
then the DCS manager is exactly what you need and you can pick many ways
to seamlessly integrate it into your application. 
That's what the JeeTS is for and you have more important stuff to do.

TIP: If you are not familiar with the Netty and Camel Frameworks you should study 
link:../../jeets-models/jeets-protocols-traccar/jeets-protocols-traccar.adoc[jeets-protocols-traccar] for more insights.


=== SpringBoot

[quote]
"link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[SpringBoot] makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can 'just run'. 
We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration."

=== Features

* Create stand-alone Spring applications

* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

* Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

* Provide production-ready features such as +
  metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration

* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

* automated, orchestrated, gracious and ordered Startup- and Shutdown Strategies

* and much more


== DCS Manager Features

The JeeTS DCS Traccar project is a production ready Microservice _and_ 
it can serve as the entry point or starting point into _your_ Tracking System.
It isolates the Traccar Protocol implementations from the monolithic Traccar GTS 
and serves the messages in form of a Java Object at a single Consumer Endpoint.

Embeddable:: the `jeets-protocols-traccar` project provides a classpath scanner
to scan any environment, i.e. JVM, for protocol classes. This scanner works for 
regular, traditional jar files and also for more complex ones, 
like the Spring Frameworks requires. And it works in the development phase
when working with source files and classes distributed accross the file system. +
Therefore you can simply use the DCS Microservice as 'just another Component'
with internals that you don't want to know as a 'user'.

Consumer Endpoint:: a DC Server has the sole purpose to accept encoded messages
from the network on a hardware port, to decode, acknowledge them 
and transform them
into something for subsequent processing, like Java Objects. +
If you are a Java Developer and want to enrich your system with life tracking messages
you can pick up the Objects from the `NettyConsumer` 
and process them any way you like - no strings attached.

Enterprise Integration:: By providing a `NettyConsumer` for the application
experienced programmers can apply any any 
link:https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/toc.html[Enterprise Integration Pattern] to hook up their own system easily. 
Pick up all incoming messages to process them however you please. 

scale / split performance:: you can launch _all_ JeeTS protocol servers 
in a single application. 
Or you can run different DCS managers for different customers or markets 
on separate machines with different performance requirements. 
This way you can make fine grained use of your system environment 
and scale the DCS Managers on the hardware, cloud, .. or whatever level.

collect / join messages:: If you do execute various DCS Managers on different machines 
you can still collect all of their data in one place - like a Message Broker -
and process them logically as if they come from a single source. 
// diagrams would help here

Full Network Performance:: 
Traccar is a complete Tracking System processing Tracker Messages 
inside the Netty pipelines - including database access. 
A database is an independent external resource
with hardware access to persist and retrieve data via a RDBMS.
Every SQL statement for device lookup, find last position, store new position etc.
slows down the performance and in the worst case the database doesn't 
react at all and the GTS can not work. +
In other contexts, like self driving cars with car2car communication, 
performance requirements are higher and the database 
can easily (and typically) become _the_ system bottleneck.
Think of many vehicles sending a load of canBUS data many times a minute
for an online analysis of the engine's performance. +
Some systems don't even bother to persist raw data.
They snap coordinates on roads, calculate, merge, aggregate engine data .. 
the incoming data streams live in the RAM. 
And the challenge rises when car's need external feedback 
to avoid a collision - fast.
Therefore the DCS Manager does not involve any external resources 
with unpredictable behavior at all. 
Let Netty do its job as fast as it can - _live processing and tracking_ !

IMPORTANT: This does not mean that the data cannot be persisted - it's simple. +
You can pick up the message stream from the DCS Endpoint, 
use your own database pool to persist the data any way you want. 
From plain JDBS with SQL statements or with JPA. 
Please visit the `my-etl` project to setup your database loader environment
and start coding. +
There is a database-loader on the JeeTS roadmap to apply 
the Java Persistence Architecture JPA with an `EntityManager`
for optimal database performance .. stay tuned.



== Project Structure

This `jeets-dcs-manager` project wraps various JeeTS projects 
in Spring/Boot and provides a Camel Endpoint to feed any System 
with live Tracking infos.
The project artifact is a single runnable Java Archive (`.jar` file) and
you can get an overview of (third party) software versions with
[source,text]
-----------------
  jeets-dcs-manager> mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose
-----------------

As you can see the Traccar Protocols are embedded in many different framework and starter components
to enable configurations according to your demands and environment.
Here's an extract with the JeeTS components:
[source,text]
-----------------
 org.jeets:jeets-dcs-manager:jar:1.3
 +- org.jeets:jeets-protocols:jar:1.3
 |  \- org.jeets:jeets-pu-traccar:jar:4.2
 +- org.jeets:jeets-protocols-traccar:jar:4.10
-----------------

The `jeets-protocols` and `jeets-pu-traccar` also represents 
a development environment for a `database-loader` and 
a Persistence Unit with JPA Entities via `EntityManager`.



== The ServerManager

As described for the underlying `jeets-protocols-traccar` project 
link:../../jeets-models/jeets-protocols-traccar/jeets-protocols-traccar.adoc#\_traccar_setup[here] the `TraccarSetup` 
// jump to bookmark - doesnt work - url is okay?
class was created to replace the *methods of* 
Traccar's original `org.traccar.ServerManager`: +
"
The `org.jeets.traccar` package was added to replace the stand alone functionality
with a generalized Setup Procedure. In the `TraccarSetup` class you will find 
everything to setup Traccar and start it up in your environment.
"

So let's see how we can achieve this for a Spring Boot application. +
The standard way to register a Bean in Spring is the @Bean annotation.
If you want to register only a few servers you can find use code of the 
link:../../jeets-models/jeets-protocols-traccar/jeets-protocols-traccar.adoc#_2_cameltestsupport_with_netty[single server test]
and easily hard wire it yourself - as little exercise.
For this (development) purpose the DCS Manager
provides the `@Configuration class Config`
where you can place your `@Bean` definitions.
But we're up to more. 

We want to replace the original `org.traccar.ServerManager` 
with one that leverages the DCS management with SpringBoot:
the `org.jeets.dcs.traccar.ServerManager`.
Comparing these two `ServerManager` implementations is helpful to follow 
the paradigm shift and get a grip on internal SpringBoot functionalities. 
Although SpringBoot provides complete automation - 
we still want to control what's going when, where and how.


=== Traccar Setup

The steps to take for a Traccar Setup were described in the 
link:../../jeets-models/jeets-protocols-traccar/jeets-protocols-traccar.adoc#_traccar_setup[protocols-traccar] 
project which is imported into the DCS manager as the main prerequisite.
You can run and compare the tests
[source,java]
----
jeets-protocols-traccar org.jeets.dcs.DcsTests
jeets-dcs-manager       org.jeets.dcs.DcsSpringBootTests
----
to see the Setup Process in action and better follow the steps below.

In the DCS manager the `org.jeets.dcs.Main` class 
simply runs the `@SpringBootApplication` 
which fires up the `BeanFactory` 
to collect `@Configuration` classes and so on.

For the Traccar Setup we need to read the configuration file
[source,java]
----
TraccarSetup.contextInit(traccarSetupFile);
----
before we can load only the required classes
[source,java]
----
TraccarSetup.loadConfiguredBaseProtocolClasses();
----
and loop over the classes to create and register 
the protocol's `*InitializerFactory`
[source,java]
----
TraccarSetup.createServerInitializerFactory(clazz);
----
and finally compose the Netty URI for the Camel `TraccarRoute` 
and register it.

To create valid Beans in a loop you have to find the correct place to implement, 
instantiate and register without disturbing the Spring functionalities.
We have extended the `ServerManager` with the `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` 

see javadoc: 
[quote]
"Factory hook that allows for custom modification of an application context's
bean definitions, adapting the bean property values of the context's 
underlying bean factory. +
The method `postProcessBeanFactory` is called by
Spring startup process just after all bean definitions have been loaded. +
Modify the application context's internal bean factory after its standard 
initialization. All bean definitions will have been loaded, but no beans
will have been instantiated yet. This allows for overriding or adding
properties even to eager-initializing beans.
"

Ok, now we know where to create our Beans programmatically. 
But we run into another problem when we want to look up 
the path and name of the configuration file to filter the loop.

[quote]
"Spring boot internally uses Binder APIs to 'map' the resolved properties 
into the @ConfigurationProperties beans. This resolution happens during the 
springboot startup process AFTER the BeanFactoryPostProcessors get created. 
Therefore the Binder API is applied EnvironmentAware to load the properties explicitly.
"

So we extend the `ServerManager` with the `EnvironmentAware`
interface to allow Spring to set the Environment with 
[source,java]
----
@Override public void setEnvironment(Environment environment)
----
as it starts up. +
Now you can compare the registering of Beans in the *Camel* `DcsTests`
[source,java]
----
camelContext.getRegistry().bind(protocolName, pipeline);
camelContext.addRoutes(new TraccarRoute(uri, protocolName));
----
or for *Spring* in the `ServerManager` and the `DcsSpringBootTest`
----
beanFactory.registerSingleton(protocolName, pipeline);
beanFactory.registerSingleton(routeBeanName, 
                     new TraccarRoute(uri, protocolName));
----


== Testing

On the 
link:../../jeets-models/jeets-protocols-traccar/jeets-protocols-traccar.adoc#_traccar_setup[protocols-traccar] 
page you can read about the complete testing cycle
of the Traccar Protocols over the complete repository build:

. Original Traccar Protocol Tests + 
  `jeets-protocols-traccar .. org.traccar.*`
. CamelTestSupport with Netty +
  `jeets-protocols-traccar .. org.jeets.dcs.DcsTests`
. DCS tests with Spring/Boot/Starters and Netty +
  `jeets-dcs-manager .. org.jeets.dcs.DcsSpringBootTests`
. Integration Testing +
  `jeets-dcs-itest`


=== DcsSpringBootTests

The `DcsSpringBootTests` demonstrate how to 'autowire' 
Camel's `ProducerTemplate` to send messages, receive responses 
and `ConsumerTemplate` to receive and validate the server messages.

The `@SpringBootTest` annotation is all you need to start up
the DCS manager, being a `@SpringBootApplication`.

Now you can test any _protocol_ server by looking up its _protocol_ port 
from `TraccarSetup`,
send messages with known content, assert _protocol_ specific ACKs
and finally assert known content on the received messages 
from the `NettyConsumer` 
endpoint `'direct:traccar.model'` on server side.

See `testTeltonikaServer()` for implementation details 
and how to add tests for your own protocol messages
or sequences of messages, i.e. to test identification and registration. 


=== Integration Tests

Besides using the protocol unit test phases for your development 
the `jeets-dcs-itest` provides the complete picture and demonstrates
how to compile, deploy, run _and_ send test messages 
to the installed and configured DCS Manager.

This integration test should serve as a guideline for JeeTS development, 
testing and as a proof of concept before checking in new code.

Please proceed to the next section to compile, run and test your protocols.


== Compile and Run

The regular compilation and testing of this application already takes place in the 
<<../../jeets-docs/building.adoc#Building-Anormalbuild,normal build>>
of the complete repository.
When working with this project and without changing 
the nested projects in the hierarchy above you 
can change from the repository root to the project folder 
and repeatedly build from there:
[source,text]
-----------------
  cd jeets-server-etl\jeets-dcs-manager
  mvn clean install
-----------------

This project compiles a runnable `jar` file
in the project's target folder which can be launched with:
[source,text]
-----------------
  jeets-dcs-manager> java -jar target/jeets-dcs-manager-1.3-exec.jar
-----------------

Please note that the new DCS Manager does not need the argument
to point to Traccar's setup file.
The path to the _repositories_ `traccar.xml` (and `default.xml` if needed) file 
is added to Spring's `application.properties` with Maven's resource filtering.
You can check its resolved content in the `target` folder!
Refer to Spring documentation to externalize these properties 
and point them to _your_ `traccar.xml` configuration.

When the DCS Manager is starting up it logs path and file to the properties 
and the configuration files used: 

 org.jeets.traccar.TraccarSetup - initializing traccar.Context with C:\.../traccar.xml
 org.traccar.config.Config - setup Config with: C:\.../traccar.xml
 org.traccar.config.Config -    config.default: default.xml
 org.traccar.config.Config - prepend path from traccar.xml to default.xml
 org.traccar.config.Config - load config file: C:\.../default.xml

Then you can check, if all Protocols were found in _all_ `protocols*.jars`
and which ones are loaded according to the configuration.
Here you can see one `jeets-protocols` and three `jeets-protocols-traccar`
(of 210):

 TraccarSetup - found 211 BaseProtocol classes in 784 millis
 TraccarSetup - loaded class: JeetsProtocol      protocol: jeets      port#5200
 TraccarSetup - loaded class: RuptelaProtocol    protocol: ruptela    port#5046
 TraccarSetup - loaded class: TeltonikaProtocol  protocol: teltonika  port#5027
 TraccarSetup - loaded class: WliProtocol        protocol: wli        port#5209
 
until all configured `serverInitializerFactories` and Routes are registered
 
 ServerManager - registered jeets server         netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5200?...=#jeets...
 ServerManager - registered teltonika server     netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5027?...=#teltonika...
 ServerManager - registered ruptela server       netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5046?...=#ruptela...
 ServerManager - registered wli server           netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5209?...=#wli...
 ServerManager - Setup 4 Traccar BaseProtocol servers in 858 millis - ready for Camel to start!

Then you can see Camel starting and binding the protocol servers one after the other

 o.a.c.i.engine.AbstractCamelContext  - Apache Camel 3.3.0 (CamelContext: camel-1) is starting
 o.a.c.component.netty.NettyComponent - Creating shared NettyConsumerExecutorGroup with 9 threads
 o.a.c.c.n.SingleTCPNettyServerBootstrapFactory - ServerBootstrap binding to 0.0.0.0:5200
 o.a.c.component.netty.NettyConsumer              - Netty consumer bound to: 0.0.0.0:5200
 o.a.c.i.engine.AbstractCamelContext  
               - Route: jeetsRoute started and consuming from: netty://tcp://0.0.0.0:5200

Now you can use your hardware Trackers to send real messages 
or you can use the `jeets-device` to send recorded messages at development time.
Or simply run the `DcsSpringBootTests` to see messages arriving.
One test is sending a `jeets` protobuffer

	sending uniqueid: "395389"
	position {
	  devicetime: 1597050941880
	  fixtime: 1597050941880

	  course: 100.123
	  speed: 12.345
	  event {
		event: KEY_ALARM
		alarm: ALARM_SOS
	  }
	}

which arrives at the server and Netty's LoggingHandler shows every event trigger

Finally you can see the message content output from the `traccar.MainEventHandler` 
to the `NettyConsumer`.

you can test the graceful shutdown with `CTRL+C`.

=== No consumers available on endpoint!

Note that th DCS Manager provides a Producer Endpoint, but no Consumer.
It makes no sense to run the DCS Manager alone
and if you do you will get this error after a timeout:

[source,text]
