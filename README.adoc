= The JeeTS Source Repositories

The Name JeeTS reflects "GPS Tracking Software with Java EE", 
i.e. "Jee" T.S. like in G.T.S. +
JeeTS components are developed against the Traccar GTS as de facto standard
and can be combined with it in many - including complimentary - ways
to create individual Tracking Solutions and integrate them into existing Systems.

== Overview

The JeeTS Source Code is hosted in the two Repositories
// absolute paths to github server, use internal relative paths!
// define base path before /jeets and /jeets-web

 * https://github.com/kbeigl/jeets/[*/jeets*] +
  Tracking Components compatible with the Traccar Backend customizable
   for individual Tracking Solutions

 * https://github.com/kbeigl/jeets-web/[*/jeets-web*] +
  In its core a Spring MVC Component to rapidly develop individual Frontends 
  with different Spring-Boot Starters against the Traccar REST API

When developers tackle a new software they first try to identify the System Model. +
In case of Traccar the Model is provided in two ways:

 * Traccar Entities are coded in the `org.traccar.model` package 
   and are related to each other in the program flow.

 * Traccar's REST API provides role based access to the Entities and
  the Client programer can collect these informations to form another model.


With the next releases the JeeTS will provide a JPA specified Persistence Unit
with Entities _and_ Relations. This model can be used on server side (with
an `EntityManager`) and on client side (without `EntityManager`)
for easy ORM navigation over the instantiated Entities.


Both repositories are compiled, build and installed in the same manner
described on this page. +
For individual documentations please follow the individual links above.

== Building the JeeTS Repositories

Instructions to compile and test each repository.
Please note that the two repositories are build independent of each other.
Their structures are updated and synchronized continuously 
and the installation process is the same for each repository.
The link above is describing how to compile the JeeTS repository
but also applies to the JeeTS Web repository.
Generally the regular JeeTS repository should be compiled first
to supply artifacts for the JeeTS Web build.

=== Developing JeeTS with Eclipse

Instructions to import the complete JeeTS repository 
or individual projects into Eclipse.
These instructions also hold for the JeeTS Web repository.
