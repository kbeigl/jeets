= JeeTS JPA Persistence Unit

This project provides a JPA Persistence Unit and 
represents the 'driver' to access a database generated by Traccar GTS. 
The project is versioned after the Traccar releases.
(Note that not every Traccar version increment implies an ERM modification.)
The Entity Relation Model standardizes all higher level JeeTS components.

== Standardization

While the Traccar ERM is implementing data access without JPA
this project is providing a JEE specified JPA 2.1 persistence unit.
The Entities were modeled from an existing Traccar database and
can be used in conjunction with a productive Traccar GTS.
All Entities of the Traccar ERM form the jeets-pu-traccar ORM.

Explicit tests between ERM and ORM are mandatory to run JeeTS components
against a running production system, i.e. Traccar GTS 
to avoid object-relational impedance mismatches!

The jeets-models are fundamental to all higher level components and should be
checked and counter checked for usages in JeeTS components. For the time
being JNDI and AppServer, i.e. Arquillian Tests are not executed in this
project in order to keep it database oriented.


=== Entity Relation Model

Traccar's database has many tables to administer the Traccar GTS,
while the actual tracking data is collected 
in only three tables in the middle of the diagram.

=== Simple Data Model

If you focus on the incoming probe data the model becomes simple.
For receiving GPS messages only the three tables (and objects) Device,
Position and Events are required. 
They have database- and object relations 
that should be tested for every new use case:

=== Object Relation Model

By using a JPA Persistence Unit with `@Entity` classes (and `persistence.xml`)
developers can transmit `Device` objects 
with internally related `Position` and `Event` objects in a single message.
The same holds for the JeeTS Protobuffer protocol and allows bulk messages
or collecting Positions and Events over time and transfer them in a single message.

//image::.\diagrams\deviceORM.png[deviceORM,624,288]

This single device message holds an object relational model
with one device-, two position- and five event entities.
These ORMs can be created in Java on client side, encoded in binary Protobuffers,
transfered over the network, decoded back to Java on server side.
And once they have reached the 'system' each device, position and event
can be handled individually.


== Model updates

Please note that each PU version defines a well defined database state
with tables, attributes and relations. 
Yet a JPA model _does not define changes!_
Traccar is making use of liquibase to propagate model changes 
and as you might have experienced all table names were changed
from versions 3.x to 4.x
Since the messages only use three tables the JeeTS PU 
can simply adopt changes manually before upgrading the version.

WARNING: When upgrading your Traccar distribution the datamodel
is modified implicitly and you will have to counter check
the JeeTS model.

Once the JeeTS model is in sync with the Traccar model the JPA
can be used to create a complete database on the fly,
which is especially useful in test environments.
JPA also enables you to export complete `sql` scripts
to run against a newly created database instance.

JPA 2.1 is setup in the persistence.xml file. 
The specification defines the following long list of parameters:

	javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-source
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.drop-source
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-database-schemas
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-target
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source
	javax.persistence.schema-generation.connection
	javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source
	javax.persistence.database-product-name
	javax.persistence.database-major-version
	javax.persistence.database-minor-version


== Testing

WARNING: Do *not* apply these tests to production database 
	as it will be modified, or even dropped!

This project provides a Test Framework to assure the compatibility 
of the Traccar ERM with the jeets-pu-traccar ORM.
The EntityManagerSchema class can be applied to create database
or create- and drop scripts for each ORM (version) change.
It can also be used for interactive cyclic testing ORM to database
to database scripts to another database ...

By default 
These scripts are *not* created during run- or compile time as part of the 'mvn test' runs. 
The class should be manually applied, ONLY if the ORM is changed, i.e. after version increments. 
You can generate the sql create and drop scripts needed to the regular test cycle.

The 'mvn test' cycle will run the setup and tear down scripts via sql-maven-plugin
to conserve static scripts as an implicit regression test - in case of changes.

If you plan to setup your own ORM for JeeTS note that the 'JPA test framework'
is configured in the parent pom and you can start your project by basically
copying this traccar project, search and replace naming and do a test run
before you start replacing the persistence unit for your purposes.

== DBUnit tests

	TODO

// Note that DBUnit requires an existing database with a valid schema.
// The EntityManagerSchema class can be used to interactively setup the database
// before you re/run the DBUnit tests to reveal regression problems.

// DBUnit does not create databases, 
// but helps to populate and clean a database for every testrun.
